## 📊 Project Overview  

This project dives deep into the **Cars93 dataset**, analyzing key attributes of various car models to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers. Through **data visualization, correlation analysis, and anomaly detection with Isolation Forest**, we refine our understanding of car characteristics and their relationships.  

**Key steps in this analysis:**  
✅ Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values, Encoding, Preprocessing)  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualizations, Correlation Heatmaps)  
✅ Outlier Detection (Isolation Forest Implementation)  
✅ Insights & Interpretations (Price Variability, Mileage Trends, etc.)

## 🔬 Key Insights  

🔹 **Price vs Performance:** Higher horsepower cars tend to have a **significantly higher price range**.  
🔹 **Fuel Efficiency & Weight:** Lighter cars generally exhibit **better mileage**, confirming real-world trends.  
🔹 **Correlation Findings:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📈 **High correlation**: `Horsepower` & `Price` (Luxury cars = more power 💰)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📉 **Low correlation**: `Passengers` & `Length` (Bigger doesn’t always mean more space!)  
🔹 **Outliers Identified:** Some **extreme values** were detected and filtered using an **Isolation Forest model**.
