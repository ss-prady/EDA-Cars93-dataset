# Exploratory Data Analysis & Outlier Detection on Cars93 Dataset  

**Course:** DAI-101 (IIT Roorkee Spring 2025) | **Assignment:** Data Cleaning & EDA  
**Objective:** Perform an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and detect anomalies in the **Cars93 dataset** using **machine learning** techniques.  

---

## Project Overview  

This project dives deep into the **Cars93 dataset**, analyzing key attributes of various car models to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers. Through **data visualization, correlation analysis, and anomaly detection with Isolation Forest**, we refine our understanding of car characteristics and their relationships.  

**Key steps in this analysis:**  
Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values, Encoding, Preprocessing)  
Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualizations, Correlation Heatmaps)  
Outlier Detection (Isolation Forest Implementation)  
Insights & Interpretations (Price Variability, Mileage Trends, etc.)

## Key Insights  

**Price vs Performance:** Higher horsepower cars tend to have a **significantly higher price range**.  
**Fuel Efficiency & Weight:** Lighter cars generally exhibit **better mileage**, confirming real-world trends.  
**Correlation Findings:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**High correlation**: `Horsepower` & `Price` (Luxury cars = more power)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Low correlation**: `Passengers` & `Length` (Bigger doesn’t always mean more space!)  
**Outliers Identified:** Some **extreme values** were detected and filtered using an **Isolation Forest model**.

## Technologies Used  

- **Python**   
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** (Visualizations)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Outlier Detection)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Documentation & Analysis)
